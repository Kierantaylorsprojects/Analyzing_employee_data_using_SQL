# Analyzing_employee_data_using_SQL

### 1. In this project, I started by using Lucid Chart to create an ERD. 

### 2. I then used SQL to analyze a companies employees during the 1980's and 1990's using data from 6 CSV files. 

### 3. More specifically, I designed a SQL database and created six tables to correspond with the six different CSV files. 

### 4. I then completed queries to answer key HR questions. 

### 5. I finished this project by running multiple queries to generate the reports.
